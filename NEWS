New in version 0.32:

* GNUtrition will periodically check gnu.org for new versions and notify 
  you when a newer version is available.
* The USDA data has been updated to the latest version, SR24.
* GNUtrition now uses the built-in SQLite3 Python module and the database 
  has been converted to SQLite. If you have been using a GNUtrition version 
  that uses a MySQL database the database will be converted to the SQLite3 
  format. Once the conversion has been done there is no longer a need 
  for you run a MySQL server for GNUtrition. The new database is stored 
  in ~/.gnutrition. Be sure to back it up.
