REQUIREMENTS

    GNUTRITION is written is Python. It requires the following:

	  * Python >= 2.6  (Python 3.x will not work with current sources)

      * The Python bindings to GTK+ and GNOME.
        On Fedora 15 the package name is pygtk2

      For documentation:
      * docbook-utils for db2html command  (not critical)

UPGRADING

    Note that if you are upgrading from versions < 0.32 GNUtrition now uses
	the built-in SQLite3 Python module sqlite3. If you have been using a 
	GNUtrition version which uses a MySQL database the gnutr_db database will
	be converted to the SQLite3 format. There is no longer a need for database
    username or password. The new format is stored in your home directory in
	the .gnutrition directory (back it up!).

    If you have recipes created with version 0.2 they must be re-created.

INSTALLATION

    To compile and install gnutrition

        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install

    should work, and will install into

        /usr/local/bin
        /usr/local/share
	
    Use the `--prefix' command line option to install elsewhere. 
    For example to install in your home directory under gnutrition:
		
		mkdir ~/gnutrition
        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/gnutrition
        make
        make install

	To put gnutrition in your $PATH (for above example) add

       export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/gnutrition/bin

	to your .bash_profile (or .profile, whichever you use). Then log out
	out and log back in.

    That's it! You can now type "gnutrition".
