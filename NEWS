New in version 0.32:
* GNUtrition will periodically check gnu.org and notify you when a new  
  version is available.
* The USDA data has been updated to the latest version, SR24.
* The minimum Python version has been increased to version 2.6. GNUtrition 
  is not compatible with Python 3 at this time.
* GNUtrition now uses the built-in SQLite3 Python module and the database has 
  been converted to SQLite. Your existing MySQL database will be 
  automatically converted. Once that's complete you no longer need to run a 
  MySQL server for GNUtrition, eliminating a dependency. The new database is 
  stored in ~/.gnutrition. Be sure to back it up.
